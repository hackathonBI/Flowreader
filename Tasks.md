Possible tasks:
====

1. Which articles are covering same stories (i.e. new iPad launch)? How the story is spreading in time?

2. Is it possible to cluster articles automatically according their topics (i.e. travelling, science, design, weather...)? If so, is it better to let machine decide the topic (auto clustering) or categorise topics made by humans?

3. Is it possible to identify which story becomes viral in near future (others adopt it)?

4. What's articles language? What's accuracy of language detection? Can you isolate time series patterns for each language?

5. If you know user's interest, are you able to automatically suggest him relevant content?

6. Anything else! :-)
